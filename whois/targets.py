# Changelog:
# 0.0.1 -- small fix for trgtdatecomp vs currdatecomp to less than.
# 0.0.2 -- Added generator which uses a new filter function from tail.
# 0.0.3 -- Reverting change made from 0.0.1, which was a mistake:
#          if trgtdatecomp > currdatecomp, we've reached a date that precedes
#          the target date.
